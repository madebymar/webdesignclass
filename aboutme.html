         <h4>
             <p>My name is Mariana Barros, I am currently a student at Arizona State University majoring in Design Studies. <br>
             I have an educational background and professional experience in architectural design. <br> 
             <br>
             While studying this, I gained an extensive graphic, video, and animation skillset and I now specialize in videography and graphic design.
             I've always been a storyteller first, long before I discovered videography. It all started with constantly writing silly imaginary pieces when I was a kid, until the day I picked up a camera and discovered another medium to express myself. 
             My favorite thing in the world to do is capture authentic moments and turn them into a film that will last forever. <br>
             <br>
             It's no surprise that videography is the love of my life, but traveling is just as important to me. I'm endlessly inspired by new adventures, nature, and cultures. I love waking up to new horizons, making new friends, and exploring what this world has to offer.<br>
             When I'm not at my computer editing, designing, or out and about filming, you'll find me playing my guitar or piano, dancing salsa all night, or binge-watching netflix.
